Making dev changes to Electronite . Electronite is a drop-in replacement for electron that provides an enhanced font rendering system. Make your dev changes the same way as for an Electron viewer. This project works in either a web browser or the Electronite viewer. Only add code to Electron/Electronite that are necessary for it to handle things that web browser already do (e.g., Print, Find, Zoom, Back, Forward). Avoid coding in such a way that prevents web browser use. 💡 The way to develop in Electronite is to start by modifying the code that is used by your dev viewer. The file structure to focus on is below, in particular electronStartup.js and preload.js. Make changes here first to test in local dev: . |-- [linux | windows | macos] |-- viewer |-- project |-- payload |-- app |-- appLauncherElectron.sh | appLauncherElectron.bat |-- electron |-- electronStartup.js |-- favicon.png |-- favicon@1.5x.png |-- favicon@1.25x.png |-- favicon@2x.png |-- preload.js . Deploying tested dev changes to Electronite . If changes to electronStartup.js are required, reproduce these changes in the following two files: . |-- buildResources |-- electron |-- electronDevStartup.js (used by the viewer and the Linux app; launches the viewer without starting the server) |-- electronStartup.js (used by the Windows and MacOS apps; starts the server then launches the viewer) . Test electronDevStartup.js by re-running the build_viewer script. See Electronite Dev Viewer above. Also used in the Linux app. Test electronStartup.js by either building locally on Windows or MacOS or by pushing a branch, building via git hub actions, then testing the resulting stand-alone installs for Windows/MacOS. If a change needs to be made to favicon*.png, make those changes in the globalBuildResources directory. The same test instructions above apply. If a change needs to be made to the appLauncherElectron script, it will need to be made in 3 different places and tested on three different operating systems. Those file lives at: . | linux\\buildResources\\appLauncherElectron.sh | windows\\buildResources\\appLauncherElectron.bat | macos\\buildResources\\appLauncherElectron.sh | . Test by either building locally on all three operating systems, or by pushing a branch, building via git hub actions, then testing the resulting stand-alone installs. Local Installer Build .
