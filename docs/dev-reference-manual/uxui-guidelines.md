## Dialog

> ðŸ’¡ Use the [Dialog](https://mui.com/material-ui/react-dialog/) component instead of a [modal](https://mui.com/material-ui/react-modal/). The modal is the low-level element meant to block the interaction. The Dialog is based on a modal, but specializes in providing information and further actions.

A Dialog is composed of three main parts:
* **Title**. Contain a brief, clear statement or question. It should communicate the Dialog's purpose.

    > Background color is `secondary`.

* **Content**. Anything needed for the context, from supporting text to full-size form. 

    > With long content, use the [`scroll=paper`](https://mui.com/material-ui/react-dialog/#scrolling-long-content).

* **Actions**. There's always a way to go back (*Cancel*). And the main action is on the right. The label should reflect the action performed when clicked.

    If any [required field](https://pankosmia.dev/uxui-guidelines/#required-fields) is in the content, the action button is disabled until they are completed.

    > *Cancel*. Text button, primary color.
    >
    > *Action*. Contained button, primary color.

Responsiveness is configured as follow:

    > ðŸš§ TBD (full-width + variable maxWidth depending on breakpoints?).

## Icons

[Material Icons](https://mui.com/material-ui/material-icons/?theme=Outlined) should be in the `Outlined style` by default.

## Required fields

When information is required to proceed:
* Required field(s) should show an asterisk `*` after the label.
* Above required field(s), explain what the asterisk does. This message is displayed once, after any title and before required field(s).

    > Add `* Required fields.`, with the typography style `subtitle2`.

* The action button below the field(s) is enabled only when all required fields are completed.

## Theme

### Main colors
{: .no_toc }

- You can find matching primary and secondary colors using a palette generator like [Coolors](https://coolors.co/d4e09b-f6f4d2-cbdfbd-f19c79-a44a3f). If you already have a primary color in mind, you can also generate a matching secondary color with a [Color Wheel](https://www.figma.com/color-wheel/).

    > It's a good practice to [check contrast](https://app.contrast-finder.org/?lang=en). Online color tools tend to rely on different contrast ratios, better choose which standard to follow.  
    Note that MUI uses colors in different contexts, so try your colors as background for text, but also as text on a plain background.

### Generate MUI color variants for `theme.json`
{: .no_toc }

- Use the [MUI Theme Creator](https://zenoo.github.io/mui-theme-creator/). On the bottom-right you can edit a `main` color to automatically generate its `light` and `dark` variants, with the needed corresponding `contrastText` color.

    > Note those are different from a light/dark app theme. They are a lighter and darker shade of the main color. You can use them to play with contrast in the interface.

### Generate `appbar-chip-inactive` colors
{: .no_toc }

- If your primary color is **darker** than your secondary. Use `secondary dark` as `appbar-chip-inactive main` and [Generate MUI color variants](https://pankosmia.dev/uxui-guidelines/#generate-MUI-color-variants-for-theme.json) from it.
- If your primary color is **lighter** than your secondary. Use `secondary light` as `appbar-chip-inactive main` and [Generate MUI color variants](https://pankosmia.dev/uxui-guidelines/#generate-MUI-color-variants-for-theme.json) from it.
